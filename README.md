# Brain Tumor Detection - Visualization
This project contains multiple classification models for brain tumor detection.
The data set contains images of healthy brains and tumor brains with glioma, meningioma and pituitary tumors.
Initially, we use binary classiication, and classify: * Glioma brains against healthy brains
                                                            * Logistic Regression.
                                                            * Logistic Regression + PCA
                                                            * Support Vector Machines
                                                      * Meningioma brains against healthy brains
                                                            * Logistic Regression.
                                                            * Logistic Regression + PCA
                                                            * Support Vector Machines
                                                      * Pituitary brains against healthy brains
                                                            * Logistic Regression.
                                                            * Logistic Regression + PCA
                                                            * Support Vector Machines
Then, we use neural networks for multiclass-classification (Tell which class a tumor belongs to).
