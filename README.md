# Brain Tumor Detection - Visualization


This project contains multiple classification models for brain tumor detection.
The data set contains images of healthy brains and tumor brains with glioma, meningioma and pituitary tumors.


Then, we use neural networks for multiclass-classification (Tell which class a tumor belongs to).
